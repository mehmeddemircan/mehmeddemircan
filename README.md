### Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
I am a 23-year-old software developer with a strong passion for building reliable and meaningful software solutions.
I mainly focus on backend development with .NET, while also having a keen interest in creating modern and user-friendly interfaces using Angular and React.

I see software development not just as writing code, but as a process of problem-solving, building scalable systems, and delivering real value to users.
I care deeply about clean code, maintainable architectures, and performance-oriented solutions.

I am continuously improving myself, learning new technologies, and gaining hands-on experience through real-world projects.
I am a team-oriented, curious, and motivated developer who enjoys taking responsibility and growing through challenges.
